# SOS1920-labs


Laboratory practice l10, where we begin to build the front-end part with the javaScript framework SvelteJS. 
With our back-end in NodeJS done in previous practices.

First of all you have to do 
- npm install

to download all the dependencies of the project.

Later to run the application in development mode we write 
- npm run dev 

in the console. 

Finally we would do 
- npm run build 

to put the system already in production.

And our project would work :)
