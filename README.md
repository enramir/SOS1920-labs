Laboratory practice l11, Frontend (III) GUI in Svelte.

First of all you have to do 
- npm install

to download all the dependencies of the project.

Later to run the application in development mode we write 
- npm run dev 

in the console. 

Finally we would do 
- npm run build 

to put the system already in production.

And our project would work :)
